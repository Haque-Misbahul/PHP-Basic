# ðŸ“˜ PHP Fundamentals â€“ Beginner to Advance

This repository documents my PHP learning journey, including practice code and notes from the Udemy course: **"Laravel 10 - Beginner to Advance"** by *Shakzee Arain*.  
It starts with PHP basics and gradually builds toward object-oriented concepts and more complex Laravel development.

---

## ðŸ§  Course Overview

The course introduces core PHP syntax, logic, and best practices before transitioning to Laravel 10 â€” one of the most popular and powerful PHP frameworks for web development.

This repo is focused on the **PHP Basics** section, which lays the groundwork for deeper Laravel learning.
